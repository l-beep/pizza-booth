    <h2>Neapolitan Crust</h1>
    <p>Neapolitan crust pays homage to the pizza motherland: Italia. The perfect thickness of the crust and the heavenly airiness of each bite takes you straight to a little pizzeria in Roma. </p>
    <h2>Chicago Deep Dish</h2>
    <p>Deep dish style crust has an enormous amount of gooey cheese, pizza sauce, and endless toppings hidden in between those rich layers. </p>
    <h2>Sicilian Style</h2>
    <p>If you are looking for a hearty slice, Sicilian is certainly on the road to deep dish level pizza. It does have a hefty crust to topping ratio, so be prepared.</p>
    <h2>Thin Crust</h2>
    <p>It has a nice crunch to it, and the pizza's toppings shine on their own. You won't get overpowered by a huge piece of  bread at the end of each slice. </p>

    <h2>Flat Bread</h2>
    <p>For people who want to eat pizza while staying bougie, flatbread is your perfect cover! Pair it with trendy toppings to elevate its foodie status. Throw some fresh basil garnish or balsamic glaze atop the light, bread-y base to complement the crust's sophisticated style. </p>
    <h2>Pizza Bagels</h2>
    <p>Pizza Bagels are the perfect sized snack, and they're insanely yummy.

        Relive your glory days by making your own pizza bagels --just take your favorite type of bagel, add pizza sauce and cheese, throw on some of your favorite toppings, and voila!</p>
        <h2>Cheese-Stuffed Crust</h2>
        <p>Cheese on cheese on cheese is the perfect way to describe this type of crust. If a four-cheese pizza isn't enough for you, why not stuff some more of it into the crust? The gooey richness fulfills every cheese lover's dream.</p>
        <h2>Fast Food Pizza</h2>
        <p>Fast food style pizza is a staple item at sleepovers and parties. The crust is bready, but it hits the spot. Plus, it has cinnastix and garlic knots if people are looking to branch out.</p>
